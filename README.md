# Bouncycastleroids ([live])

_'Asteroids' and bouncy castle physics, together at last!_

JavaScript handles the calculations and renders the results onto an HTML5 canvas element.

Random convex polygons are generated by selecting a random number of random points on the circumference of a circle of random radius.

Asteroids are cleaved by calculating the entry and exit points of the collided bullet and splitting the asteroid along that line segment.

## To Do

* Add "Astro Disco" kill screen.
